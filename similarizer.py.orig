		    # the nineteenth century, distinct regional codes were already
		    # developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the
		    # rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their
		    # heritage.[6] In 1888, The Football League was founded in England,

		    # become some of the most popular team sports in the world."
