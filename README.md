# Zeus-Recommendation-System
Zeus is an article recommendation system built using React Js with Flux for application architecture, MongoDb for databse and Python for server side. It incorporates user-user similarity as well as item-item similarity. A summarizer has been incorporated as well. A solr search script is also present for searching indexed JSON's and folders. This is just the server side of the system.
