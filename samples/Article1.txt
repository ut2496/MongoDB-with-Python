The film explores the relationship between an old father and his daughter on whom he completely depends. Shoojit, who earlier gave us John Abraham-starrer Madras Caf√© (2013) and Ayushmann Khurrana-starrer Vicky Donor (2012), once again proves that an entertainer does not have to be larger-than-life and unrealistic.



The beauty of Piku lies not in the story but the way it is told. The film shows that mind-boggling stories are not essential to touch hearts on the silver screen. Piku's story is too simple - it does not offer shocks or surprises. Instead, it is one of those endearing narratives where the actors' performances and nuanced ways in which the director tells the tale overpower the predictable storyline.



Juhi Chaturvedi's warm and sweet screenplay ensures that everyone who lives with or has lived with ageing parents will identify with Deepika's character. It is irritating to deal with their tantrums and we keep scolding them, but the moment we see the smallest deterioration in health, we are ready to do anything to ensure that they are back to their childish ways.



Bhashkor (Amitabh) and Piku (Deepika) are Bengalis living in Delhi. While Bhashkor spends his days obsessing over his bowel movements, Piku is a wonderful multi-tasker who manages the whole household, works at an architecture office and also tries her best to maintain an active sexual life.
